# EEG denoising using Principal Component Analysis

## Algorithm
1. The input data is of the European Data Format(.edf)
2. The Principal Component of multiple channels of EEG is less susceptible to
noise.
3. The PC of the channels are also tolerant of external artifacts such as deep brain 
stimulation as in this example.
